          Not really a writer, especially about myself when I know others are going to see it. But oh well here we go...
          This is officially my very first blog post. My Mod 1 experiences were far ranging. The first time around, I spent way
          too much time worrying what others were doing and how I was doing compared to them. That in hindsight was not a smart way
          to go about things. Here at Turing, you're not competing against anyone other than your previous self. It took a while
          for that to sink in for me.

            I used to train pretty hard and teach Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. In that I see a lot of the same concepts here at Turing. The main
          similar concept being; don't worry what anyone else is doing. Just be better than you were the day before and you'll be fine.
        </p>
        <p>
            With that concept in mind, I taclked my second time in Mod 1 very differently. I did not worry one iota what anyone else was doing.
            I went about to just to the best that <em>I</em> could. That allowed me to have much more fun, because now I wasn't moving slower than
            anyone else, I was advancing more than <em>I</em> did previously.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to not worrying how well others were doing, I took some advice from a Turing alum. She had said to take that feeling of
            frustration and despair at not knowing what it going on and reassign it to a feeling of excitement that you don't know it <strong>yet.</strong>
            That was a very big factor as well, I think. That allowed me to have more fun in the process of figuring out the solution to a problem.

            One other thing that I am sure aided me in my repeating was my previous cohort. That group of people are amazing. When I told them I was repeating,
            they were incredibly supportive. I told them i would be asking them for assitance almost everyday and their response was, "<em>Please</em> do!"
            That combined with the fact that they still invite me along when they go and do stuff, still say I'm 1705 amd a;ways will be was very nice of them as well.
            Knowing that I could lean on the for help mad eit so much easier.

            We've reached the end of what i can think of to write. I started this out warning you that, I'm not a very good writer and I think I've followed through on that
            warning. If you are reading this, and you are at Turing and are feeling that you can't do this, come talk to me and I'll tell you why you're wrong. You made it in,
            they think you can do this. <strong>You</strong> just have to know that as well!
